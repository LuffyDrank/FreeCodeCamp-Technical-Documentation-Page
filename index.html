                <header>Act cool and stay aloof.</header>
                <p>Sasuke is calm, cold, indifferent, cruel, cynical, a bit sarcastic and somewhat arrogant. 
                    In other words, he's got a cool superiority about him that comes from his confidence and power. 
                    If you want to act like Sasuke, you want to exude a sense of that superiority.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>
                    In general, when people approach you, don't give the time of day, even if it's your best friend, or a romantic interest. 
                    They are so much below you in skill and knowledge, you should act like you're bored by their presence.
                </p></li>
            </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Keep_a_chip_on_your_shoulder.">
                <header>Keep a chip on your shoulder.</header>
                <p>Sasuke has something to prove, and always seems to be dwelling on some inferiority complex. 
                    He's unwilling to acknowledge when someone is stronger than him, and obsesses when it becomes clear that he may be outmatched.
                    Start cultivating a grim and serious demeanor. </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>
                    Go on long contemplative walks like Sasuke does. Scowl while you do it.
                    Try to stop laughing at jokes, or at little trifles. 
                    Sasuke is deadly serious at all times, making it important that you focus on the gravity of life and the most important things. 
                    No time for jokes! </p></li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Be_smart.">
                <header>Be smart. </header>
                <p>You are smart, and you know it. Show people that you are smarter than them. 
                    Sasuke is hailed as a genius, even by the battle-adept Uchiha clan's standards, excelling at all that he does and finding little difficulty in more challenging tasks. 
                    Try to learn everything easily, and be the top on your class.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>
                    Study hard, especially the serious subjects like history and literature. 
                    Study the great works and commit to being a warrior monk, able to quote poetry at length and do battle in equal measure.
                </p></li>
            </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Be_quiet.">
                <header>Be quiet. </header>
                <p>Sasuke rarely talks, but when he does, he keeps it brief and to the point. 
                    Start buttoning up some and you might notice the same thing happen. If you're less likely to talk, when you do choose to speak, make sure it's to the point and serious, and you'll quickly get a reputation as a person to be listened to.
                    When you do speak, speak clearly and confidently and make pauses between sentences, for more effect. </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>
                    You must not look uncertain when you speak, just say what you mean and mean what you say. Don't stop in the middle or start fading your voice. 
                    Confidence shows that whatever you are talking you mean it.
                </p></li>
            </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Depend_on_yourself.">
                <header>Depend on yourself. </header>
                <p>Difficult challenges, easy tasks, big goals: whatever you've got on your plate, try to do it yourself without asking for help from others. 
                    Sasuke views help as a sign of weakness, and wants very much to be seen as a leader, like someone who is to be trusted, and capable. 
                    He does not take orders kindly, a sign of his self-reliance.
                    Don't look to others to validate your pride and your confidence in yourself. Sasuke's favorite word is "power" (åŠ›, chikara). 
                    So, try to gain it, in everything you stumble upon. </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>Find your inner light and your inner strength and use that as your source of confidence, not the opinions of others. Please yourself.
                    Be sexy. You have a load of self-confidence and you show it. Be yourself and definitely don't flirt with that goofball blonde.
                </p></li>
